                Pikachu (ピカチュウ, Pikachuu) is an Electric-type Pokémon which was introduced in Generation I. 
                Pikachu is renowned for being the most well-known and recognizable Pokémon. 
                Over the years, Pikachu has become so popular that it serves as the Pokémon franchise mascot. 
                It is the Version Mascot and First partner Pokémon for the game Pokémon Yellow and its remake, 
                Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!. 
                It is also well known from the anime, where Ash Ketchum, the protagonist, owns a Pikachu.

                Pikachu are small, chubby, and cute mouse-like Pokémon. 
                They are almost completely covered by yellow fur. 
                They have long yellow ears that are tipped with black. 
                A Pikachu's back has two brown stripes, and its large tail is notable 
                for being shaped like a lightning bolt, yet its brown tip is almost always forgotten. 
                Pikachu have short arms with five tiny fingers on forehands and three sharp 
                fingers on their hind legs. On its cheeks are two circle-shaped red pouches 
                used for storing electricity. They turn yellow and spark with electricity 
                when it's about to use an Electric attack, such as Thunderbolt. 
                It has also been known to generate small surges of electrical energy in 
                anger or for protection, like in the anime.

                    Pikachu evolves into a Raichu by using a Thunder Stone. 
                    It evolves from Pichu when its happiness is maxed with the trainer in game. 
                    It will evolve into Alolan Raichu if using a Thunder Stone in the Alola region.
